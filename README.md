# SOC Log Analysis Toolkit

## Overview
This project focuses on **security log analysis as performed in real Security Operations Centers (SOC)**.

It is designed to help understand how raw logs are transformed into **security insights**, **alerts**, and **investigation findings**.

This is a **defensive security project**, not an offensive or exploit-based one.

---

## Problem Statement
In real-world environments, security incidents are rarely detected by tools alone.
They are detected by **analysts interpreting logs**.

However, many learners:
- Do not understand log structure
- Do not know what “normal” looks like
- Cannot extract meaningful signals from raw data

This project addresses that gap.

---

## What This Project Covers
- Parsing structured and semi-structured logs
- Filtering noisy events
- Identifying suspicious patterns
- Basic anomaly identification
- Analyst-style reasoning over data

---

## Typical Use Case

---

## Technologies & Concepts
- Python
- Log parsing
- Data analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Security operations workflows

---

## What This Project Is NOT
- Not a SIEM replacement
- Not real-time monitoring
- Not malware or attack code

---

## Intended Audience
- SOC Analysts (entry-level)
- Blue Team Engineers
- Cybersecurity students preparing for internships

---

## Limitations
- Offline analysis only
- Sample datasets
- Detection logic is illustrative

---

## Future Improvements
- SIEM integration
- Visualization dashboards
- Advanced correlation logic
- Machine learning support
